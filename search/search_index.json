The application supports several real-time and off-line processes, which can be used to: Generate DSP filters for each individual pass band of multi-way loudspeakers Align and tune professional sound systems of any complexity and size Create reports from measured electrical and acoustic data Conduct audio research & investigations Characterise & optimise audio transducers, with automated Batch Quality Control scripting Evaluate the significant perceptual room acoustic parameters using ISO standard methods and many more! Developed for Windows\u00ae operating system by the experienced Brazilian engineer Francisco Nunes Monteiro, CrossLite+ is a fast and accurate decision making tool, which frees the operator from reliance on continuous output of measurement signals through loudspeakers or devices. CrossLite+ offers powerful post acquisition virtual processing through biquadratic IIR filters and FIR coefficients, time delay, phase shift and amplitude adjustments, with compensation for the climatic caracteristics. From the acquired system\u2019s responses curves (impulse, magnitude, phase, group delay, coherence), it is possible, in a very intuitive and accurate way, to silently simulate, analyze and make improvements by the mean of EQ, AllPass filters, HPF or LPF crossover filters, FIR filters, applied on each acquisition. Crosslite+ can import files in .txt and/or .wav formats, exported from other measurement software, such as: Arta\u00ae http://www.artalabs.hr/ Clio\u00ae http://www.audiomatica.com Klippel\u00ae https://www.klippel.de REW\u00ae https://www.roomeqwizard.com SATLive\u00ae https://www.satlive.audio Smaart\u00ae https://www.rationalacoustics.com Rita\u00ae https://www.gaudiosolutions.com If you'd like to request support for data from other platforms, please feel free to contact our technical team by email.","title":"What is CrossLite?"},{"location":"Introduction/1_1_what_is_crosslite/#what-is-crosslite","text":"CrossLite+ is a powerful, yet easy to use dual-channel FFT electroacoustic measurement and prediction software.
