# System Requirements
## Minimum Requirements 
The following computer specification is needed to run CrossLite+:
- Dual-core processor with 2.0 Gigahertz or faster clock speed
- 8 GB RAM recommended
- Windows® 8 to Windows® 10 Home, Pro, Education, or Enterprise
- 3 GB of available hard disk space
	- Note: The installer creates temporary files during installation. Thus, the hard disk space required after installation is half of the values listed.
- Screen resolution greater than 1024 x 576

## MacOS Compatibility
For MacOS® platforms running on Intel® processors, CrossLite+ can be executed in Parallels® Desktop. However, we recommend that CrossLite+ is run natively in Windows using Apple Boot Camp.
