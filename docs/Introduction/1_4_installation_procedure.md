# Installation Procedure
After CrossLite+ software purchase, you will receive all needed instructions to download the installation compressed files (.zip) via a link sent by email or directly from the official web site.

You may create a folder where you can download and store the latest available updates.

At this point, it is assumed that you are already familiar with the operating system’s application installation processes. 

Below, an example of the installer package (compressed, .zip format).

CrossLite+ software uses a license tool through a usb stick hardware/hardlock device. 
The USB device must remain connected for the software to function. 

For Brazilian customers a USB hardware key is provided after purchase of the license. 
For customers from another country than Brazil, please use an empty FAT32 formated and named “FMSCIENCE“, containing your personal “final key“ file (.kcl). 

**NOTE:** It is recommended NOT to use this hard lock/USB port device for various use, as the license key is stored and evaluated throughout the time of use of the software.
